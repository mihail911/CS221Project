Course Title: Truth and Paradox
Course Instructors: 
Course Code: PHIL23B
Course Units: 2-2
Course Description: Philosophical investigation of the concept of truth is often divided along two dimensions: investigation of the nature of truth and investigation of the semantics of truth claims. This tutorial will focus on the second kind of concern. One key impetus for a philosophical interest in the semantics and definability of truth is the challenge posed by semantic paradoxes such as the Liar paradox and Curry¿s paradox. Despite each having the initial appearance of a parlor trick, philosophers and logicians have come to appreciate the deep implications of these paradoxes. The main goal of this tutorial is to gain an appreciation of the philosophical issues -­ both with respect to formal and natural languages ­¿ which arise from consideration of the paradoxes. To this end, we will study some of the classic contributions to this area  including Tarski¿s famous result that, in an important sense, the semantic paradoxes render truth indefinable, and Kripke¿s much later attempt to provide a definition of truth in the face of Tarski¿s limitative result. Further topics include the debate between paracomplete and paraconsistent solutions to the semantic paradoxes (notably defended by, respectively, Field and Priest); the relationship between deflationism about truth and the paradoxes; and the notion of ¿revenge problems¿ (roughly, the claim that any solution to the paradoxes can be used to construct a further paradox).nThe tutorial will avoid excessive technical discussions, but will aim to engender appreciation for some philosophical interesting technical points and will assume a logic background of PHIL150 level.

Course Title: Intention and Normative Judgment
Course Instructors: Michael Bratman, 
Course Code: PHIL387
Course Units: 2-4
Course Description: Prominent views in both metaethics and the philosophy of action hold that there are distinctively practical states of mind that nonetheless play many of the roles traditionally associated with belief.  Some action theorists hold that intention is a kind of practical attitude subject to rational requirements such as requirements of consistency and coherence.  Metaethical noncognitivists hold that normative judgments are distinctively practical¿perhaps even a species of intention¿and face the well-known Frege-Geach problem because of that commitment.  We will consider what metaethicists can learn from debates about intention in the philosophy of action, and what philosophers of action can learn from debates about metaethical non-cognitivism.

The course is about these emotions, their meaning and role in morality and law.

Course Title: Good, Bad, and Rotten: The Philosophical Study of Moral Character
Course Instructors: Grant Rozeboom, 
Course Code: PHIL34S
Course Units: 3-3
Course Description: We ordinarily think there&#39;s a sense in which someone can be a good person, over and above doing well at her particular occupation (e.g., being a good firefighter), familial role (e.g., being a good sister), or political function (e.g., being a good citizen). But what does it take to be a good person, in this very general sense? And what about the opposite -- what does it take to be a bad person? We also tend to feel strongly about whether others, or ourselves, are good or bad people. In particular, we blame people for being bad and praise them for being good. But only sometimes -- if someone is bad only because, say, he had a traumatic childhood, then we tend to hold back from blaming him. So, what must be true if someone really is deserving of blame for being bad (or, of praise for being good)? And, finally, there seems to be an important difference between being bad and being completely depraved, or evil. But what underlies this difference? What distinguishes everyday badness from extraordinary evil? This course is dedicated to learning how to look for and evaluate answers to these questions. Readings will be pulled from historical and contemporary sources, including Aristotle, Augustine, Immanuel Kant, Hannah Arendt, Philippa Foot, Bernard Williams, Susan Wolf, Gary Watson, and Nomy Arpaly,

Course Instructors:

Course Description: Do you persist through time the way that a skyscraper persists through space, by having different parts at different locations?  Or are you ¿wholly present¿ at every moment of your life, in something more like the way that an elevator is present in each place as it travels up to the top floor? What criteria determine whether you now are the very same person as some unique person located at some time in the past? Is the continuity of your memories or other mental states sufficient for your survival? Can you survive the loss or destruction of your body? Do you really exist for more than just the present moment? How do different answers to these questions bear on your moral, personal, and professional obligations? What kinds of considerations could possibly help us to answer these questions? This course explores these and related issues. Readings include a mix of introductory survey, historical, and contemporary material.

Course Description: Environmental problems define and dominate the times.

In this course we will explore some of the most pivotal environmental issues facing us today using the tools of philosophy. Together we¿ll ask questions such as: Are individuals or governments responsible for solving environmental problems? What objects should we care about in the natural world (animals, living things, ecosystems?), and what do we do when environmental problems force us to make tough choices in the face of competing values? Do we have responsibilities to future generations? This course will provide a foundation for thinking about these questions and for facing our environmental problems head on.
