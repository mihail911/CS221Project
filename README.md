**Note in this database, many classes have multiple instructor names in the 'course instructor' entry.

Instructor Database Format:


(course instructor, course code)


**In this database, a single instructor is mapped to the appropriate course code.

## Note on Conventions

Method names are camel case and variable names are all lowercase.
