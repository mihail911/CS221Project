Introduction/Problem Statement
	Image:Screen shot of how crappy 'explore courses'/'courserank' is

			 **Software widely used by students
			 **Results often arbitrary
			 **Wish to support smarter, more dynamic search
			 **Improved schema for determining course relatedness


Feature Extraction (how do we relate courses to each other)
 			 **How do we relate courses to each other?
			 **Extract features from (title, code, instructor, description, unit count)

	1) In Database each course's information represented as 8-tuple

Assigning Weights/Relatedness Coefficient
	** Simple naive schemas implemented first
	** Bayesian update of priors to determine relatedness (Naive Bayes assumption)


Query Parsing 
		** How do we extract useful information from a user's query?
		** Basic natural language processing schema as follows:
			1)Tokenize text
			2)Tag parts-of-speech using NLTK tagger
			3)Chunk text based on predetermined regular expression grammars

Results
	Text

Future Work
	**Support searches based on user's history
	**More complex query searches
	**Spell-correction (edit distance)
	**Play around with other schemas for determining relatedness coefficient
	**Incorporate into 'ExploreCourses'
