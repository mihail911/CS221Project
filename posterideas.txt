Introduction/Problem Statement
	Screen shot of how crappy 'explore courses'/'courserank' is

Query Parsing (how do we extract useful info from a user's query)
	1)Tokenize text
	2) POS tagging
	3) Chunk text based on pre-defined regular expression grammars

Feature Extraction (how do we relate courses to each other)
	1) In Database each course's information represented as 8-tuple
	2) Discuss features extracted from Code/Title/Instructor/Description

Assigning Weights/Relatedness Coefficient
	1) Simple Naive schemas implemented first
	2) Bayesian update of priors to determine relatedness (Naive Bayes assumption)

Conclusion/Future Work
	1)Support searches based on user's history?
	2)More complex query searches
	3)Spell-correction
	4)Play around with other schemas for determining relatedness coefficient
	5)Get it incorporated into the real site--already better results!
