# Project Proposal

Author: Michael Dickens <mdickens@stanford.edu>

Author: Mihail Eric <meric@stanford.edu>

TODO:
1) Take a limited collection of classes from explorecourses.stanford.edu (scrape using BeautifulSoup or JS?)
2) Manually determine the relevance of the results of a search query.
3) Base-line system: Keyword search (list of professor's names, list of course names)
4) How to input queries: comma-delimited phrases?

## Task Definition

This project provides intelligent Stanford course search. It allows Stanford students to quickly find courses that meet a wide range of criteria not offered by Stanford ExploreCourses.

### Types of Queries to Support

 * 'courses taught [by {NAME PROFESSOR}] [in {QUARTER OF YEAR}] [at {TIME OF DAY}]'
 * 'courses taught by {PROFESSOR QUALIFIER}'
 * 'courses that meet on {DAY OF WEEK}'
 * 'courses in {NAME DEPARTMENT} department'
 * 'courses on {TOPICS/SUBJECT MATTER OF COURSE}'
