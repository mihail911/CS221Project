Course Instructors: 
Course Code: CS10SC
Course Units: 2-2
Course Description: Computers have come to permeate many aspects of our lives, from how we communicate with each other to how we produce and consume information. And while it is all too easy to think of computing in terms of the products and applications we see emerging from technology companies, the intellectual foundations of computer science go much deeper. Indeed, beneath the surface of the tools we use, the social networks we engage in, and the web of information we search lays a field rich with fascinating, intellectually exciting, and sometimes unexpectedly surprising ideas. In this seminar, we will explore several of the great ideas in computer science, looking at both challenging problems and their impact on real applications. From understanding how search engines on the Web work to looking at mathematical theories underlying social networks, from questioning whether a computer can be intelligent to analyzing the notion of what is even possible to compute, this seminar will take us on a series of intellectual excursions that will change the way you look at computers. No prior experience with computer science or programming is required, but a high school mathematics background, an interest in problem-solving, and a healthy curiosity will go a long way toward ensuring an enjoyable and enlightening experience. Students will work in small groups to research topics in computer science they find most intriguing. The course will also take advantage of Stanford&#39;s location in the heart of Silicon Valley by conducting field trips to local companies and the Computer History Museum.

Course Description: Nanotechnology is an often used word and it means many things to different people.

Then we discuss two classic books that offer a glimpse of what nanotechnology is: Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology by Eric Drexler, and Prey by Michael Crichton. Drexler&#39;s thesis sparked the imagination of what nano machinery might do, whereas Crichton&#39;s popular novel channeled the public&#39;s attention to this subject by portraying a disastrous scenario of a technology gone astray. We will use the scientific knowledge to analyze the assumptions and predictions of these classic works. We will draw upon the latest research advances to illustrate the possibilities and impossibilities of nanotechnology.
