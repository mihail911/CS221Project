Project Proposal

TODO:
1) Take a limited collection of classes from explorecourses.stanford.edu (scrape using BeautifulSoup or JS?)
2) Manually determine the relevance of the results of a search query.
3) Base-line system: Keyword search (list of professor's names, list of course names)
4) How to input queries: comma-delimited phrases?

Types of Queries To Support:
-'courses taught [by {NAME PROFESSOR}] [in {QUARTER OF YEAR}] [at {TIME OF DAY}]
-'courses taught by {PROFESSOR QUALIFIER}'
-'courses that meet on {DAY OF WEEK}'
-'courses in {NAME DEPARTMENT} department'
-'courses on {TOPICS/SUBJECT MATTER OF COURSE}'
